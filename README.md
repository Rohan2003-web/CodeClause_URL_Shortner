# CodeClause_URL_Shortner
A URL shortener in Python is a tool that takes long URLs and converts them into shorter, more manageable links. It utilizes a combination of string manipulation and unique identifiers to generate compact URLs that redirect to the original longer addresses, making them easier to share and remember.
